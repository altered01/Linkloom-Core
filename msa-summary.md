## 🔍 Key Implications

- **Content Licensing**: You retain ownership, but Microsoft may use shared content to operate and improve services.
- **Data Portability**: Exportable data is available via the [Privacy Dashboard](https://account.microsoft.com/privacy), with some restrictions.
- **AI Compliance**: Copilot and other AI services must be used responsibly—jailbreaking and deceptive content are prohibited.
- **Legal Waivers**: Microenterprises and not-for-profits may waive certain EU rights under Section 15.
- **Third-Party Accounts**: Accounts provisioned by others may be accessed or deleted by them.
- **Moderation Risks**: Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in suspension or termination.
